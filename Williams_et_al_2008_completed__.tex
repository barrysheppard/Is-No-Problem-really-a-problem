Williams et al. (2008) completed the first study specifically looking at MBCT and bipolar disorder. The sample included 68 participants who had at least one major depressive episode. Of the sample, 17 participants met the criteria for bipolar in remission and had suicidal ideation. Participants were randomly allocated into a group who received immediate MBCT treatment (24 unipolar, 9 bipolar) and a control group (27 unipolar, 8 bipolar) who were on a wait-list for treatment.
