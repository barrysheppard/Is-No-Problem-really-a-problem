The sixth, and final study, was a randomised controlled trial with a larger sample \cite{perich_randomized_2013}. A sample of participants with bipolar were randomised into a MBCT group of 38 and a “treatment as usual” control group of 29. Self-report questionnaires rated time to recurrence of depressive and manic episodes, the number of recurrences, a depressive rating, a mania rating, and anxiety scales. The MBCT group completed the eight week MBCT course, and both groups were reassessed 12 months after. The results found no significant reduction in time to recurrence, number of recurrences, depressive rating, or mania rating. This study did not support the generalisation of previous findings on MBCT and depression to MBCT and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. The study did, however, find “some evidence for an effect on anxiety symptoms” \cite{perich_randomized_2013}.
