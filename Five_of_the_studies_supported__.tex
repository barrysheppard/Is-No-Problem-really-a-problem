Five of the studies supported the idea that MBCT reduces levels of anxiety co-morbid with bipolar disorder. While this effect does not directly relate to the disorder itself, the effects of a co-morbid anxiety disorder on the prognosis for bipolar is notable. Anxiety disorders are co-morbid in approximately three-fourths of individuals with bipolar disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2013, p132). Those individuals who do have a co-mobid anxiety disorder are more likely to relapse, have worse sleep disturbance, are more likely to require medication, and have an increased risk of suicide (Hawke, Provencher, Parikh, & Zagorski, 2013).
