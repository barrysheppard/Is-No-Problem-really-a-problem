As a specific clinical treatment for depression, MBCT is of particular interest in the treatment of bipolar disorder. As anti-depressive drugs stimulate the release or inhibit the uptake of neurotransmitters in the brain, there is an associated risk of increasing the effect and recurrence of manic episodes. This side effect makes alternative forms of treatment for depressive symptoms desirable. As a treatment offered by licensed health professionals, it provides a consistent approach for comparison across studies. To date, a small number of studies have looked at MBCT as a treatment for bipolar. Six studies are detailed below. In all cases, participants during these studies continued with their ongoing treatment. Treatment may have included a course of medication, which could differ between individuals, and confound results to some degree.
