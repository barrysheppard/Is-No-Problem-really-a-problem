The pathogenesis of the disorder remains a subject of study, with genetic factors possibly contributing to bipolar risk \cite{fears_multisystem_2014}. In 1995, the estimated cost of the disorder in the US alone was $45 billion per annum \cite{wyatt_economic_1995}. On average, one-fifth of individuals with bipolar die by suicide (Jamison, 1996, p41). It “may account for one-quarter of all completed suicides” \cite{_diagnostic_2013}  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2013, p131).
Episodes of hypomanic and depressive mood and energy levels characterise bipolar and related disorders.
