From the 6 studies, only 2 supported the idea that MBCT reduced depressive symptoms while 3 of the 6 studies were unable to find significant differences. The 2 studies which supported the idea involved a total of 25 bipolar participants, compared to a total of 76 for the 3 studies which were unable to find differences. Based on this limited data set, MBCT is not as effective in dealing with depressive symptoms in bipolar individuals as it is with unipolar individuals.
