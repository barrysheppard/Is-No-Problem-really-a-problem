Ives-Deliperi, Howells, Stein, Meintjes, & Horn (2013) completed an additional neuro-imaging study using fMRI to study the effects of MBCT on participants with bipolar. The sample included 23 patients with bipolar disorder and 10 control subjects. Of the patients with bipolar disorder, 16 had MBCT training while the remaining 7 were assigned to a control group. Self-reported questionnaires rated mindfulness, emotion regulation, anxiety, and symptoms of stress. Participants performed a resting and a meditative mindfulness exercise during which researchers measured their brain activity with fMRI. Researchers recorded results before and after the MBCT training.
