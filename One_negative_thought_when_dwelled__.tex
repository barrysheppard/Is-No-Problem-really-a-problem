One negative thought, when dwelled upon, activates other negative thoughts until eventually a constellation of worry and anxiety is present. “Brooding is the problem, not the solution” \citep[][p30]{williams_mindfulness:_2011}(Williams & Penman, 2011, p30). Mindfulness, with its focus on, and acceptance of, the now provides a different approach. It allows an individual “to experience the world — calmly and non-judgmentally” (Williams & Penman, 2011, p45). With increased mindfulness, an individual gradually becomes aware “your thoughts are not you” (Williams & Penman, 2011, p64).
