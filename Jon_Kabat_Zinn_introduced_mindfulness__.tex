Jon Kabat-Zinn introduced mindfulness into the field of psychology, taking lessons from Buddhist meditation and developing a non-secular program. He began his Mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) in 1979 and has since produced many papers on the benefits of mindfulness \citep{kabat-zinn_outpatient_1982,kabat-zinn_clinical_1985,kabat-zinn_effectiveness_1992,miller_three-year_1995,kabat-zinn_influence_1998,samuelson_mindfulness-based_2007,ludwig_mindfulness_2008}. Researchers developed scales to measure how mindful an individual is; the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale \citep{brown_benefits_2003}, the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills \citep{baer_assessment_2004}, the Toronto Mindfulness Scale \citep{lau_toronto_2006}, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised \citep{feldman_mindfulness_2007}, and the Philadelphia mindfulness scale \citep{cardaciotto_assessment_2008}. Using these scales research investigated correlates with mindfulness.
