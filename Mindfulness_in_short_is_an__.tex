Mindfulness, in short, is an awareness of, and a presence in, the now. It derives from the Buddhist meditation practice, involving a focus on the breath, the body, and sensations. In so doing, the practitioner practices self-regulation. In maintaining a focus of attention on the now, they develop a conscious awareness of their thoughts and thought patterns. The practice proposes that there are two distinct kinds of thinking; self-reference in the now and self-reference across time, a theory supported by fMRI studies \citep{farb_attending_2007}.
