In 2010, \cite{weber_mindfulness-based_2010} completed a feasibility trial on MBCTâ€™s long-term effects on bipolar disorder. Fifteen participants with bipolar attended at least four MBCT sessions. Participants completed self-reported questionnaires before the program, 1 month later, and 2 months after that. The study did not find a significant improvement in mindfulness scores on the KIMS \cite{baer_assessment_2004}, depressive, or hypomania scales across time. The study did find that the KIMS score significantly negatively correlated with depression severity prior to the MBCT program.
