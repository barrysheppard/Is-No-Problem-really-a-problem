The primary treatment for bipolar is mood stabilisers, often lithium, although recently anti-convulsants have proved successful to flatten the extreme emotions. Anti-psychotic medication is used to control manic episodes. Anti-depressant medication is used to control the depressive episodes; however anti-depressants can trigger and increase manic episodes \citpe{zhang_antidepressants_2013}. In extreme cases, electroconvulsive therapy is the preferred option \citep{dierckx_efficacy_2012}. A combination of medication and psychotherapy, usually, has the best results.  Mindfulness, in short, is an awareness of, and a presence in, the now. It derives from the Buddhist meditation practice, involving a focus on the breath, the body, and sensations. In so doing, the practitioner practices self-regulation. In maintaining a focus of attention on the now, they develop a conscious awareness of their thoughts and thought patterns. The practice proposes that there are two distinct kinds of thinking; self-reference in the now and self-reference across time, a theory supported by fMRI studies (\citep{farb_attending_2007}.
