Expanding upon the \citep{williams_mindfulness-based_2008} study \citep{miklowitz_pilot_2009} completed another pilot study which looked at a sample of 16 participants with bipolar in remission who completed an eight week MBCT program. Researchers compared self-reported scales before and after the program. The study found reductions in depressive symptoms. Researchers found manic symptoms reduced slightly, which is notable as an increase in manic symptoms would be a potential concern with the reduction in depressive symptoms. Anxiety decreased modestly, however without a control group to compare with, it is difficult to draw conclusions. This study does have some limitations. The sample size is small and included no control group. As an exploratory study the paper succeeded on building on the \citep{williams_mindfulness-based_2008} study and is the first investigation of the effect of MBCT on manic symptoms.
