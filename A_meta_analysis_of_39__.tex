A meta-analysis of 39 studies relating to mindfulness \citep{hofmann_effect_2010} found that a mindfulness-based therapy was effective in improving anxiety and mood symptoms. Empirically supported benefits of mindfulness, as collated by \citep{davis_what_2011}, suggests mindfulness positively correlates with reduced rumination, reduced stress, improved working memory, improved focus, reduced emotional reactivity, increased cognitive flexibility, and increased relationship satisfaction among other benefits.
