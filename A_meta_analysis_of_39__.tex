A meta-analysis of 39 studies relating to mindfulness (Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010) found that a mindfulness-based therapy was effective in improving anxiety and mood symptoms. Empirically supported benefits of mindfulness, as collated by Davis & Hayes (2011), suggests mindfulness positively correlates with reduced rumination, reduced stress, improved working memory, improved focus, reduced emotional reactivity, increased cognitive flexibility, and increased relationship satisfaction among other benefits.
